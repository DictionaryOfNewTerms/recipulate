# Recipulate — Landing Page

> **Type**: Public landing page (https://recipulate.org)
> **Real project**: `roar-gits/recipulate` (private). All product work happens there.

This working directory is a **presentation artifact**, not a project. It hosts only the public-facing description of "recipulate." Edits are limited to landing-page content, design tokens, and deploy config.

For project-level work (architecture, initiatives, integrations, users, doctrine sweeps), switch to `roar-gits/recipulate`. Do **not** rebuild `.claude/docs/` infrastructure here.

See also `.project-meta` at the working-dir root.
